# Preamble
---
**Gate to Stars – Ultimate Starfield Overhaul**

Gate to Stars is a fully optimized and carefully curated mod collection that transforms Starfield into a richer, more immersive, and more responsive experience.<br>
Everything has been tuned, visuals, gameplay, performance, stability, and atmosphere, to deliver a seamless journey through the Settled Systems.

The collection currently includes over 700 integrated mods, all tested and balanced to work together.<br>
The long-term goal is to expand the list to 1,000+ fully stable mods, while keeping performance and immersion top-tier.<br>


**What Gate to Stars Delivers**


* A More Alive Galaxy — improved environments, weather, lighting, and enhanced locations like Neon and Akila.
* Better Gameplay — smarter AI, refined combat balance, meaningful encounters, and smoother mission flow.
* Enhanced Outposts & Ships — more building options, better modules, immersive interiors, and cleaner transitions.
* Clean Visual Upgrade — refined textures, atmospheric effects, and lighting improvements without losing performance.
* Quality of Life Upgrades — cleaner UI, improved markers, smarter prompts, and reduced clutter.
* Stability & Compatibility — tested load order, custom patches, and deep integration for a smooth, crash-free experience.

**Gate to Stars is built to feel natural and lore-friendly, an upgrade, not a rewrite.**

## Installation

For manual installation, follow this link: 
[How to install modlist](https://github.com/Ry-Squid/Gate-To-Stars/blob/main/How%20to%20install.md)

For installation via the Wabbajack gallery, follow the instructions below.


## Installation via Wabbajack

The **Gate To Stars** modlist is available in the **non-featured section** of the Wabbajack Gallery now. You can install it by following these steps:

1. Open Wabbajack and browse **Modlists**. Filter for **Starfield**.  
   - Make sure to **tick the "Non-Featured" filter** so that the Gate To Stars list appears.  
   - Additional filters exist, but you typically don’t need to use them.

2. Find the **Gate To Stars** list in the non-featured section and click the **Download** icon.

3. Set the `Installation Location` to a blank folder at the root of a drive, for example:  
D:\WJ\Gate-to-Stars

- The `Download Location` will update automatically.  
- Avoid using Windows Protected Directories.  
- You may have Installation and Download locations on separate drives if you prefer, but the Installation folder should be on an **SSD or NVMe**. Using an HDD may cause stuttering and poor performance.
- If you have a **Nexus Premium** account, downloads will be automated.  
- Without Premium, you will need to manually click the Download button for each mod. Installation itself will be automated regardless of account status.

4. After installation completes successfully, you may delete the **Downloads** folder to save space.

5. Open **Mod Organizer 2** in the folder where you installed the collection.  
   - Before clicking the `Run` arrow, check the **Separators** such as **Optional** or **Ultrawide** options.  
   - Enable any presets you want to use (for example, Ultrawide options if you have an ultrawide monitor).  

6. Click the `Run` arrow in MO2 to start the game with the selected presets.  
   - This ensures the game launches with all the mods and settings you have configured.
